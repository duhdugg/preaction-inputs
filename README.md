# Preaction Inputs

This is a Bootstrap v4 compatible library of React components intended to provide a consistent and responsive experience for most basic user input needs.

This is currently under active development, so the best way to learn about how it's used is to review the [code on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/drelyn86/preaction-inputs/blob/master/src/App.js).
